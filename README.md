# Todd Blacklaw's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository contains a collection of my personal and academic projects. Feel free to explore and reach out if you have any questions.

## About Me

I am a University Physics Student with a passion for software developement, I have a strong drive to explore differnt projects to expand my skillset and knowledge and I enjoy being able to use my knowledge of Physics in some of my projects. 

## Projects

## Todo List App

- **Description**: A simple and intuitive todo list application with features like adding, editing, deleting tasks, setting priorities, due dates, categories, and dark mode.
- **Technologies Used**: React, CSS
- **Files**: [Todo List App Folder](personal/todo-app)

### Chess Game

- **Description**: A JavaScript-based chess game with a simple user interface. Players can move pieces and the game keeps track of turns.
- **Technologies Used**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery
- **Files**: [Chess Game Folder](personal/chess-app)

## Academic Projects

### Ising Model Simulation

- **Description**: This project simulates the Ising model, a mathematical model of ferromagnetism in statistical mechanics. It uses the Metropolis algorithm to simulate the behavior of spins on a lattice at different temperatures.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Files**: [Isingmodel.py](academic/isingmodel/Isingmodel.py)

### Lennard-Jones Potential Simulation

- **Description**: This project simulates particles in a 2D box interacting via the Lennard-Jones potential. It includes a machine learning model to predict Lennard-Jones parameters based on particle positions and velocities.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, NumPy, Scikit-learn, PyTorch
- **Files**: [lennardJonesMdl.py](academic/lennardjonesmdl/lennardJonesMdl.py)

### Resolution and Magnification Estimation

- **Description**: This project processes an image captured using a Raspberry Pi and Pi cam in a 3D printed housing to act as a microscope, to calculate the resolution and magnification based on the intensity profile of a resolution target. It uses Gaussian fitting to estimate the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the intensity profile's derivative.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scipy, Scikit-image
- **Files**: [resolution.py](academic/resolution/resolution.py)
