## About Me

I’m a penultimate-year **MPhys Physics student at Heriot-Watt University** (graduating 2027), with a technical focus on **Quantum Communications**, **Numerical Modelling**, and **Systems Engineering**.

My work blends experimental physics with high-level programming to build reliable, scalable, and insight-driven scientific tools. I’m currently seeking a **Summer 2026 internship** in an R&D-focused environment (physics, software, or interdisciplinary systems).
