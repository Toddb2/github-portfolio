% Acquire an image from your camera
image = imread('image11.jpg');

% Process the image to identify features 
% You can use edge detection, corner detection, or other image processing techniques.
% Here, we'll use edge detection
edgeImage = edge(rgb2gray(image), 'Canny');

% Measure the distance between features to calculate the resolution
knownDistanceMicrometers = 43300;

% Calculate the distance between features in pixels
% For simplicity, this example calculates the average distance between edges.
edges = bwlabel(edgeImage);
stats = regionprops(edges, 'Area', 'Centroid');
centroid = cat(1, stats.Centroid);
numFeatures = size(centroid, 1);
distances = pdist(centroid);
averageDistancePixels = mean(distances);

% Calculate the resolution in micrometers per pixel
resolutionMicrometersPerPixel = knownDistanceMicrometers / averageDistancePixels;

% Display the resolution
fprintf('Resolution: %.2f micrometers/pixel\n', resolutionMicrometersPerPixel);

% calculate the magnification using the resolution and known target feature size
knownFeatureSizeMicrometers = 43300;

% Calculate the magnification
magnification = knownFeatureSizeMicrometers / resolutionMicrometersPerPixel;

% Display the magnification
fprintf('Magnification: %.2f\n', magnification);
